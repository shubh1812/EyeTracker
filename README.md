# EyeTracker
You can add such functionality to your VideoView using LookAtMe
A simple 👀 tracking and 👦 detection android app, made using Google vision api.

This is the basic idea and for learning purposes I created this but much more advanced features can be added using Google vision API and by some open source libraries.

Using this I have created an app in which it checks whether my eyes are open or closed if it finds my eyes closed then Video gets paused automatically 😀
It is working so accurately, it reads even a single blink of my eye but the condition is, Face must be detected very well. 😁

I think many platform like YouTube, Netflix can implement such things so that if user found sleepy then it automatically pause video and save our data also. 😁😅
